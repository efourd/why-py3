# why-py3

Python 3.12 containers for deprecated OS

## Why why-py3?

I needed python 3.12 for some testing purposes on older versions of Debian / Ubuntu.

I couldn't find containers that did this so I made them.

## This is dumb

I know, I wish I hadn't **NEEDED** to do this.

## Need / Want more images?

Open an Issue and maybe I'll do it, but it isn't hard and if you can do it maybe open a PR with your change.
